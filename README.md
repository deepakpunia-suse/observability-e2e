# Observability E2E Tests

This repository contains end-to-end (E2E) tests for monitoring installations in Rancher. Follow the steps below to set up and run the tests.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Go is installed on `1.22.0`.
- Rancher is installed and configured.
- Ensure you have cloned this repository.

## Configuration

Before running the tests, ensure the `cattle-config.yaml` file is correctly configured. This file contains essential parameters for running the tests.

### Example `cattle-config.yaml`

```yaml
rancher:
  host: <Rancher URL>
  adminToken: <Your Admin Token>
  insecure: True
  clusterName: local
  cleanup: false
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values (`<Rancher URL>`, `<Your Admin Token>`) with the actual values.

## Running Tests

### 1. Via Command Line

Go to the `observability-e2e` directory and run the following command:

```bash
go test -timeout 60m -run ^TestE2E$ github.com/rancher/observability-e2e/tests/e2e -v
```

This command will:

- Run the E2E test suite located in the `tests/e2e/` directory.
- Display detailed output about the test progress and results.

### Example Test Output:

```bash
=== RUN   TestE2E
Running Suite: Monitoring End-To-End Test Suite - /Path/observability-e2e/tests/e2e
